# Bike-Sales-Analysis-
[Bike Sales Dashboard](![Bike Sales Dashboard](Bike%20Sales%20Dashboard.PNG))
I dove into a Bike Buyers dataset to identify what actions drives bike purchase. Beyond the charts, here are three takeaways from the dataset: 
a. Income analysis shows that male customers have a higher average salary than female customers. While this higher purchasing power correlates with the higher volume of bike sales among men, it is important to consider other contributing factors such as commute needs or gender-targeted marketing.

Recommendation: Investigate if the current product line or pricing strategy is unintentionally alienating the female demographic, regardless of their income.


b. The 31-54 age bracket is our 'Gold Mine'. They have the stability and the need. 

Recommendation: 
Marketing efforts should be doubled down here while investigating why the <30 demographic is lagging.

c. While the 0-1 mile category contains the highest volume of customers, it also displays the highest volume of non-purchasers. This reveals the Proximity Paradox (proximity does not equal necessity), implying that since the people in this category live close to their jobs, the utility of a bike is low.

Recommendation: To address this high non-purchase rate in our largest demographic, the company should consider moving away from marketing the bike as a transportation tool, to marketing it as a wellness and workout tool.
